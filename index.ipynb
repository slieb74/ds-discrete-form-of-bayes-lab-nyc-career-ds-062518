    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem can most easily be used for classification by setting a threshold for the probabilty, and assuming that the answer is true if the probability is greater than our threshold.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is most powerful when used iteratively, where the posterior for a given round becomes our prior for the next round.  For instance, let's say our company opens a new coffee shop in another town, and that shop does not have much data yet.  Purchasing habits may be different in that part of town, but we won't know until we have a sufficient amount of data to compare the two.  To use Bayesian Inference to make predictions with a smaller dataset from the new store, we can incorporate **_Informative Priors_** calculated as posteriors from the dataset at our main store.  In this way, if we wanted to know the probability of a customer at the new store buying a donut given that they have ordered a coffee, we can use the code we've written on the new dataset, but with $P(A) = 0.6936385$.\n",
